# Random-Layouts-DnD
Python program to automatically create specified environment for DnD

I am using the python library kivy. To open the project you will need to install kivy on your device.
Go to https://kivy.org/doc/stable/installation/installation-windows.html for windows

Currently only the opening screen happens and none of the buttons do anything
